# Global Warming Pong

## Brief

Write a program that demonstrates the link between global warming and man made gas emissions

- Any language is acceptable
- It could be an education tool, a game or a simulation?

# Game Rules

- Ensure that the number of sun rays trapped in Earth's atmosphere remains under ten.
- Move by dragging to the left and right, which will rotate the Earth.
- As more rays enter Earth's atmosphere, the Earth becomes hotter.
- Greenhouse gases prevent the rays from escaping into space.
- Rotate Earth to allow the rays out where there are gaps in the greenhouse gases insulating Earth.
